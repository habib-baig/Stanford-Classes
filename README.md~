## Stanford online classes projects

My code for the programming assignments for Stanford's online classes:  

* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Introduction to algorithms (AlgoClass)

Some data files are git-ignored when too large (e.g.
AlgoClass 4th PA). Also, code is really not beautiful, I didn't prettify
it when the answers were correct.


EDIT: I didn't have enough time to complete NLP, sadly. Only the forst 5 projects are here.
